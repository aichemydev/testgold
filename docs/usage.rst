Create a Test
---------------------------
As you normally write a selenium test, go ahead and create it in usual form. Supported formats are:

* Java TestNG Fully Contained Jars for Selenium/Webdriver tests. Currently only TestNG jars are supported, its fairly easy to create one. Note that the jar has to contain all libraries and dependencies for it to work.
* Python Selenium. Embed your test as a single python file or archive. Examples will be provided soon.
* Javascript Selenium. Embed a single JS test calling selenium. Archives will be supported soon.
* Selenium IDE. Perhaps the easiest of all. Record a test on the Selenium IDE and then download the JSON that is generated and upload it to us.

Upload Process
---------------------------
You can either upload files directly or put in a github url along with a github token for the download.
Once the test is uploaded, the test is run and our AI will understand your test, and heal it as necessary.
