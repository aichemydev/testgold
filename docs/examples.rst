Examples
=========

Java Selenium with TestNG
---------------------------
- ReactBank example
- Go to https://github.com/aichemydev/selenium-java-examples
- Build 2 jars (the ONLY difference between the 2 jars is the website they operate on)
- Submit the old Jar to the TestGold platform for learning
- Try it on the modified new jar, you will notice that it correctly fails the jar at first, but then heals it based on the learnings from the old jar.
- As a bonus, you get suggestions to improve your xpaths and more.


Python Selenium Tests
---------------------------
- ReactBank example
- Go to https://github.com/aichemydev/selenium-python-examples
- There are 2 python script tests - first https://github.com/aichemydev/selenium-python-examples/blob/master/reactbank/reactbank_test_old.py as the script on the old site
- second https://github.com/aichemydev/selenium-python-examples/blob/master/reactbank/reactbank_test_new.py
- Again, note that the only difference between the two python scripts are the different urls for the tests
- Submit the old python script to the TestGold platform for learning
- Try it on the modified new python script, you will notice that it correctly fails the script at first, but then heals it correctly based on the learnings from the old python script.
- As a bonus, you get suggestions to improve your xpaths and more.

Javascript Selenium Tests
---------------------------
- ReactBank example for JS with NodeJS
- Go to https://github.com/aichemydev/selenium-js-examples
- There are 2 JS tests - first https://github.com/aichemydev/selenium-js-examples/blob/master/reactbank/reactbank-test-old.js as the script on the old site
- second https://github.com/aichemydev/selenium-js-examples/blob/master/reactbank/reactbank-test-new.js
- Again, note that the only difference between the two JS scripts are the different urls for the tests
- Submit the old JS script to the TestGold platform for learning
- Try it on the modified new python script, you will notice that it correctly fails the script at first, but then heals it correctly based on the learnings from the old python script.
